On this page, you will see my design highlights of V2EX and other projects.

I launched V2EX in 2010 -- an online community of developers and designers. Primary topics include programming, content creation, gaming, Apple, Android, and various hardware. It also provides a place for members to post job listings or sell personal stuff.

Now, according to [Alexa Traffic Rank](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/v2ex.com), it is a top 1000 website globally and top 100 in China.

I did the design of the website, as well as most of the Python backend code. I enjoy the design part most.

Of course it has a dark mode.

#### V2EX Nodes

V2EX organizes topics into Nodes. Each node has an icon. You can add nodes to personal favorites and show them all on one page. This page also supports drag-and-drop to adjust the order of nodes.

My wife [Yi Han](https://www.yihandesign.com/icon-design) designed some icons for the nodes.
