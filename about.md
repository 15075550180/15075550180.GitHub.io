My name is Xin Liu, and I usually go by @Livid in various online spaces. It is my handle on the Internet since the early 2000s. Axisymmetric is the reason I like that word.

For most of my life so far, I am a designer and programmer. I make websites. One of the bigger among all I created is V2EX.com.

It is an online community of developers and designers. Since the inception, my goal is to make a great place for discussing technical details -- those whys and hows when people are building something.
